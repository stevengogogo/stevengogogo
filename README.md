## Hi, I'm Shao-Ting "Steven" Chiu ðŸ‘‹

- Here is my latest CV: [CV_ShaoTingChiu.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22011507/Chiu_Shao-Ting_2026_ece.pdf)
- I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University with a passion for physics-informed machine learning (PIML), operator learning, and LLMs for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). My research focuses on developing efficient, interpretable, and scalable neural network architectures to solve complex scientific problems.

I have experience in:

Neural PDE Solvers: Developing models like my BumpNet architecture, which is highly interpretable and efficient.

In-Context Learning: Pioneering non-transformer approaches like DeepOSets for operator learning with linear complexity and superior parameter efficiency.

Scientific Computing: Applying models to real-world problems such as CO2 sequestration modeling and fluid simulations.

## Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that best represent my work. You can find more details in the pinned repositories below.

### DeepOSets

A novel non-autoregressive neural network for in-context operator learning. It's the first non-transformer approach of its kind, offering a significant speedup and efficiency over traditional models.

Publication: Featured in the NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Foundation Models for Science.

### BumpNet
An interpretable and efficient neural PDE solver that uses a basis-expansion neural network architecture. It requires significantly fewer parameters than conventional PINNs, yielding faster training and better generalization.

### Free RBF-KAN
A new approach to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with radial basis functions. This work improves accuracy by 10x and offers a 2x speedup in PDE simulations compared to the original KAN.
